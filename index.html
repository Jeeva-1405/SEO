      <h3>Technical Analysis: The Finishing Engine</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Wicket-keeper Batsman / Tactical Advisor</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> (Retained/Mentor)</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar</p>
      
      <p>Dhoni's value is derived from his **match intelligence (IQ)** and elite **Death Overs Strike Rate (SR)**, particularly against pace. His core technical skill is his ability to maintain a **Still Head** while executing the helicopter shot or the flat-bat jab, generating power from rapid hip rotation rather than backlift.</p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>CSK utilizes him as a **Specialist Finisher (Overs 17-20)**. His average SR in these overs consistently exceeds **200**, primarily exploiting the small boundaries at Chepauk. His key technical vulnerability remains slower bowlers or off-spinners using a wider line outside the off-stump in the middle phase.</p>

      <h3>Technical Analysis: The Tempo Setter</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Opening Batsman / Leadership Core</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> Retained/₹12 Cr</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Jan 31, 1997, Pune, Maharashtra</p>
      
      <p>Gaikwad is defined by his **exquisite timing and exceptional balance**. His technical strength is the **strike-rotation efficiency** in the middle overs, maintaining a boundary percentage of around 15% while keeping a dot-ball rate below 35%—a rare combination for an anchor. His preferred scoring zone is through the covers and down the ground, using minimal movement.</p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>CSK mandates him to bat through the innings, acting as the **primary anchor** for explosive middle-order hitters. His chief tactical vulnerability is the short-pitched ball aimed at the body or the corridor of uncertainty against high-end left-arm pace, leading to a higher false-shot percentage early in the innings.</p>

      <h3>Technical Analysis: The Three-Dimensional Containment Specialist</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> All-rounder (LHB/L-Arm Spin)</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> Retained/₹16 Cr</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Dec 6, 1988, Jamnagar, Gujarat</p>
      
      <p>Jadeja’s bowling mastery lies in his **laser-like accuracy and rapid pace through the air (95-100 km/h)**, which minimizes the time batsmen have to adjust. Technically, his stock ball targets the stumps or the 4th stump line, prioritizing **containment (Economy Rate)** over flighted deception. With the bat, he is a primary **Death Overs Finisher** against spin.</p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>Tactically deployed for the **Middle Overs (7-15)** to choke the run rate. His fielding metrics (direct hits per match) are statistically world-leading. His batting vulnerability is a lack of sustained power against high-velocity pace bowling outside of the last two overs.</p>

      <h3>Technical Analysis: Spin Dominator</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Middle-Order Power Hitter</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> Retained/₹4 Cr</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Jun 26, 1993, Mumbai, Maharashtra</p>
      
      <p>Dube’s technical niche is his **overwhelming superiority against spin**. He uses his tall leverage and high backlift to easily clear the boundary rope, boasting a statistical **Strike Rate vs. Spin well over 150**. His preferred method is the classic lofted straight drive or mid-wicket flick, minimizing lateral movement.</p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>His role is highly specialized: enter the crease when a spinner is operating and accelerate rapidly. His major technical weakness is his **high false-shot percentage against short-pitched pace** delivered at over 140 km/h, which is a common strategy employed by opposition captains to get him out.</p>

      <h3>Technical Analysis: Swing and Slot Hitter</h3>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Bowling All-rounder (LHB/L-Arm Medium)</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> ₹18.5 Cr (Auction Target)</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Jun 3, 1998, Northampton, England</p>
      
      <p>Curran's bowling technique centers on **early conventional swing** with the new ball, coupled with a highly effective **wide-angle slower ball** used extensively in the death. His batting is characterized by a high **boundary-hit frequency** and a knack for finding the "slot" for his pull/slog shots.</p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>CSK would deploy Curran to take **powerplay wickets** and execute 2 overs at the **death**. His strength is performing under pressure, as evidenced by his high wicket share in tournament finals. His technical risk is his tendency to bowl a predictable "length" in the middle overs, leading to a higher-than-desired Economy Rate in that phase.</p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Fast Bowler (Sling)</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> Retained/₹80 Lakhs</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Dec 18, 2002, Kandy, Sri Lanka</p>
      
      <p>Pathirana's value is purely derived from his **low-arm slinging action**, which creates a unique, difficult-to-predict trajectory. His technical focus is the **consistent execution of the toe-crushing yorker**. The lower release point and high pace mean the ball reaches the batsman quicker than expected, disrupting their timing. </p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>He is exclusively the **death-overs enforcer (Overs 16-20)**. His technical weakness is the high **Wide/No-Ball frequency** due to the extreme nature of his action and the small margin for error required to execute the yorker. His BBI (Best Bowling in Innings) often comes from exploiting late-order batsmen who struggle with his pace and angle.</p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Fast Bowler (L-Arm Seam)</p>
      <p><strong>Auction price:</strong> ₹7 Cr (Auction Target)</p>
      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Dec 5, 1997, Tonk, Rajasthan</p>
      
      <p>Khaleel's technical advantage is the **left-arm angle**, creating a difficult line for right-handed openers. He uses a skiddy pace and focuses on hitting the hard, back-of-a-length, which offers minimal room for the batsman. He is an effective **Middle Overs wicket-taker** when pitches offer minor seam movement.</p>
      
      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>CSK would acquire him specifically for the **Powerplay and Middle Overs (8-14)** to break partnerships. His main tactical liability is his **tendency to leak runs on the leg-side** when over-pitching his deliveries, leading to a higher boundary percentage when under pressure.</p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Batsman (Top-order)</p>

      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Sep 24, 2004, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh</p>
      
      <p>Rasheed possesses a **classical, low-risk batting technique** built on a solid defensive base.

      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>His role is long-term development as a **potential top-order anchor/number three**. His immediate technical challenge is the **acceleration phase** (SR in the 100-130 range), where he struggles to quickly transition from defense to attack against high-quality pace, which limits his early impact in T20s.</p>

      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Dec 11, 2000, Mumbai, Maharashtra</p>
      
      <p>Mhatre is valued for his **domestic utility and LHB/Off-spin combination**.

      <p><strong>Born:</strong> Nov 18, 1999, Wellington, NZ</p>
      
      <p>Rachin is technically sound with the bat, characterized by a **clean base and strong follow-through**, enabling effortless boundary-hitting through the V.

      <h4>Tactical & Statistical Breakdown</h4>
      <p>He is a flexible overseas option, primarily used as a top-order batsman. His bowling is a bonus, utilized when a genuine wicket-taking spinner is required. His main vulnerability is a higher **false-shot rate against high-pace cutters and wide slower balls**, indicating a minor challenge adjusting to the pace variations common on Indian pitches.</p>
